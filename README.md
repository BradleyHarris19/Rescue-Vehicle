# Rescue-Vehicle
The Rescue Vehicle I built for my final engineering project
## Outline
This is the code used for  my rescue vehicle that was a part of my Leaving Certificate Engineering course (2020). This project was built using platform.io and is supposed to control the functions I built to satisfy the breif: [Held here](https://www.examinations.ie/misc-doc/IR-EX-87401439.pdf) The code looks for the serial message from the [controller](https://github.com/BradleyHarris19/Rescue-Vehicle-Controller) and acts accoringly; turning on the motors or the buzzer.

## Hardware 
In this project there are a number of motors that control the actions of the manipulator arm, motors for the treads and a servo to tilt the arm. Using an Arduino Nano, a L298N driver for the main motors and L9110 motor drivers for the rest. Everything is powered with a LiPO battery.
